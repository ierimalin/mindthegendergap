Title: Mind the (Gender) Gap: Analysing Statistical Relationships between Gender and Political Ideology

Abstract: Does gender have an impact on ideology? Scholars argue that a modern gender gap has emerged since 1980s where women are more left-aligned than men due to the increased cultural salience of women’s issues which are generally represented by left-leaning parties. This study replicates [Ruth Dassonneville’s longitudinal study](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.12384#:~:text=The%20results%20show%2C%20first%2C%20that,in%20the%20ideological%20gender%20gap) on the relationship between gender and ideological self-identification with a limited time scope of 2004 – 2018. It also analyses the impact of regime type on the gender-ideology relationship. We find that women tend to self-identify as more left than men on average. We also find that this gendered ideological gap widens over time and is influenced by regime type.
